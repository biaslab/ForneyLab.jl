    "# Composite nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the convenient properties of Forney-style factor graphs (as opposed to regular factor graphs) is that they naturally allow for composability: one can draw a box around part of an FFG and treat this box as a new type of factor node. For example, one can combine a gain (multiplication) node with the addition node in a so-called *composite node*, as depicted in the following graph (Fig. 4.2 from Korl's [A factor graph approach to signal modelling, system identification and filtering](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/82737)):\n",

    "<img src=\"./figures/information_filter.png\" width=\"350\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Composite nodes are useful for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Building large graphs becomes more convenient by 'packaging' repetitive parts of the graph as composite nodes.\n",
    "2. One can define 'shortcut rules' for message updates, which might be more efficient and/or numerically stable than performing vanilla message passing on the internals of the composite node. For example, in the schedule shown above, message (4) is calculated directly from messages (2) and (3). The shortcut rule might exploit the matrix inversion lemma, or involve some optimization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the use of composite nodes, in this demo we will build a gain-addition combination that constrains\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "    x_1 = x_0 + b\\cdot u_1\\,,\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where `x_0` and `u_1` have Gaussian priors, and b is a constant matrix. We are interested in computing a belief over `x_1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first construct a \"flat\" graph that represents the gain and addition contraints as two distinct factors, and generate a schedule for inferring a belief for `x_1`. Then, we compare the resulting schedule with a schedule generated on an FFG with a _composite_ gain-addition node. Finally, we show how to register a custom update rule with ForneyLab."
